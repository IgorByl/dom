            <h1>Soyuz TMA-14M</h1>
            <p class="main-text">	
                Soyuz TMA-14M was a 2014–15 flight by a Russian Soyuz spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS). 
                Its crew, members of Expedition 41, were Russians Aleksandr Samokutyayev and Yelena Serova, and American Barry E. Wilmore. 
                After launching aboard a Soyuz-FG rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, the spacecraft reached low Earth orbit approximately nine minutes after lift-off. 
                It docked with the ISS's Poisk module just under six hours after launch, following a four-orbit rendezvous. TMA-14M remained docked to the ISS for just 
                under six months before departing to return Samokutyayev, Serova and Wilmore to Earth. After undocking the spacecraft deorbited and began its descent (pictured), 
                with the mission crew landing safely just over three hours later.
